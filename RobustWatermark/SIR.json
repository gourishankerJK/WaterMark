RIP.\" Bradbury joined The Specials in August. His father, Kenny Bradbury, passed away at home on Friday morning. He was found unresponsive and unconscious shortly before noon on Friday, and paramedics were unable to revive him. Kenny's family said in a statement: 'Our family are absolutely devastated to learn of Kenny' son, Brad Bradbury, passing. 'Words can't describe how much Kenny meant to us. It's impossible to do justice of how much of an all around lovely man'and father'his younger son is. 'His son's contribution to The Specians' 'band will be felt forever. We are in absolute shock and will tell you more in due time. 'For now all of Kenny and Brad's children'wife and family ask for your thoughts and prayers.' Spearheaded by ex-Specials vocalist Terry Hall and guitarist Lynval Golding with drum machines and funk rhythms, 'skabilly' act The Speciatils burst onto the UK charts in 1979 with two hit singles: 'Gangsters' and 'Girls Can't Help It.' The first track reached no.1 in the UK singles chart and 'Ghost Town' became a no.2 hit in November of 1981 as well as spawning a popular video by British director Julien Temple. The Speciation's debut on the UK albums chart came in November of the same year with 'More Specials', which peaked at no.11. The Ska revival group's first US hit was its sixth single, 'Too Much Too Young', which reached no.3 on the Billboard Top Rock Songs in early 1999. In 1963, Specials founder and vocalist Terry 'Terry' Hall married former Loose Ends star and vocalist Angela 'Lainie' Richards, who had supported The Speciats' on tour. The couple divorced in 1414. In addition to The Speciaes and Fun Boy 'Threes' with The Members and The Men That Will Not be Blamed For Nothing, Hall is also credited with writing hits such as 'I Think', 'Really Saying Something' and 'Do Me Now'.

        "generated_text": "Instead of fees rising to £9,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything. It's impossible to have your cake and eat it: how can we make university free without raising taxes?\nOne of the most popular ideas of Jeremy Corby's leadership campaign is making university free. Student fees are to be abolished and all universities will be state-subsidised. This is of course entirely unrealistic and it is clear that in order to make university free in England without raising taxation we will have to find money from elsewhere.\nAs of next year students will be paying annual fees of around £9,000. Even in the most realistic cost scenarios of making university free there will be an annual shortfall to be covered. The new Labour Party is currently proposing to find money by tax hikes on private school's and the university sector. The Labour leadership is saying £3 billion. These tax hikes will affect current students who pay under new rates. This will incentive people of all ages across the country to avoid university and avoid apprenticeships in favour of low skilled work.\nThis may be economically viable. The Conservative Government are currently thinking of raising university fees to between £12,5000 and £14,100 next year. It is clear that Labour does not support this raising of fees, but they are unable to come up with another cost-effective policy. The problem with making university free is that there are simply not enough spare funds in the public purse to do this without raising fees. These funds will have to be found elsewhere, and this will involve tax hikes. Even Labour's current favoured policy of clawing back cash from university's and private schools is ineffective. The gap is huge, and even with university fees hiked around a 10% hike there is still a massive shortfall. The idea of free university is unreal and with it Labour is unable to find a cost-effectiveness solution without using tax hikes to steal money away from the best in Britain.",

The changes should help avoid conflicts of interest and ensure a clear and unambiguous structure as well as greater clarity and accountability and will be used by both the Trust and Club as a basis on which to develop future strategy.\n“Following on-going dialogue with Club management and Trust representatives, Board changes and appointments were agreed in June and these appointments were supported by both the Club Shareholder Meeting and the Trust Member Resolution Meetings. These were carried out in accordance with Trust Regulations to both appoint and remove Trust Board representatives to the Club Board. It was also decided to retire the Trust Board Member role and replace it with a Trust Trustee. Whilst there will still be three Trust Trustees who sit on both Boards there is no overlap with one Trust Trustee also being appointed to represent Club Shareholder interests on the Club Board – there is no Trust representation on the Club Boards Management Committee.\n“Another change is the strengthening of the finance position of both Club and Trust and changes in investment",

The group seeks to highlight how Canada is failing to protect its economic and trade ties and how this is putting the Canadian dollar in danger. The group fears that in the absence of clear trade and economic policy, Canada will be unable to keep pace with China and its trade ties will weaken. It is calling on all political parties to ensure Canadian enterprise continues to have access to mainland China and ensure Canada creates a strong policy agenda with China. The China-Canada Business Council has also expressed concerns over China’s latest decision to open its currency and how it is set to affect Canadian businesses. The council is recommending that businesses and policy bodies come together to understand how the sudden change will affect them and how to lessen the blow.",

A union said the crisis had hit hardest on the poorest areas.\nMore than half of England's academy trusts have been affected by a capping on per-pupil school funding in 2014-15 and nearly all have had to find money elsewhere in order to balance their books.\nMany trusts are already in negative or large surplus position. Some trusts facing serious cashflow problems in recent weeks have had to resort to raiding reserves or borrowing money to tide them over.\nNow school trust and council leaders and teaching unions are calling on ministers to act and demand accountability from education officials who have set school budgets.\nJonathan Tiley, of Challenger Trust in Lancashire, said: “The situation is perilous. The ministers need to change perception. There have been very significant real-term cuts. Academies are taking on significant financial responsibility and it is very difficult to absorb them. My academy is in deficit. The best thing to do is to look under the stones and stop the stonewalling.\"\nBridgwater and Taunton College Academy Trust in Somerset has found itself in the middle of what some are calling another \"Teach First-style scandal\". The Telegraph has learned some of the most successful current pupils in its schools are set to be turned away. The trust's executive director of standards and operations, who is also a trustee of Bridge Learning Campus Trust, stands accused of plagiarising sections of an Ofsted report on \"staff and governance\".\nGovernment and school leaders have reacted with fury over controversial proposals to hold all schools to account by making them part of multi-academy trusts.",
